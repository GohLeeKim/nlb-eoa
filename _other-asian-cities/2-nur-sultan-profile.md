### **Introduction**

**Nur-Sultan**, known as **Astana before March 2019**, is the capital city of Kazakhstan. It is located in the north-central part of the country, along the Ishim River, at the junction of the Trans-Kazakhstan and South Siberian railways.[^4] Founded in 1824 as a Russian military outpost, Nur-Sultan became an administrative centre in 1868. Its population had reached 33,000 when it was made an *oblast* (province) in 1939.[^5]

The city grew in importance during the Soviet period by the government’s Virgin and Idle Lands Campaign from the mid-1950s. In 1961, the city was named Tselinograd, meaning “City of the Virgin Lands” in Russian. There was much new construction and the establishment of various research and higher educational institutions such as teacher training, agriculture, medicine, engineering and construction. Following Kazakhstan’s independence in 1992, the city was known as Aqmola. In 1994, the Kazakh government resolved to transfer the national capital from Almaty to Aqmola, a process that was completed in 1997, and the city’s name was changed to Astana (“Capital City” in Kazakh), the following year.[^6]

After he took office in 1990, President Nursultan Nazarbayev began spending the country’s oil profits on a drastic expansion and reconstruction of Astana. The government hired Japanese architect Kurokawa Kishō to design the plan for Astana’s new broad avenues and blue and gold buildings, including the Presidential Palace. Nazarbayev also employed British architect Sir Norman Foster to design the new Palace of Peace and Reconciliation, a 62-metre-high pyramid that includes, among other things, a library and an opera house. The city continued to develop rapidly throughout Nazarbayev’s presidency, and, on 20 March 2019, the day after he left office, the city was renamed Nur-Sultan in his honour.[^7]

### **Geography**

Located in the centre of Kazakhstan, the territory of Nur-Sultan exceeds 722 square kilometres with a population of more than one million. The city consists of three districts – former capital Almaty, Saryaka and Yessil. Situated in the dry steppe zone, which is a sub-zone of dry grass steppes, Nur-Sultan’s climate is sharply continental with cold and long winters and hot, moderately arid summers. Its convenient location in the centre of the Eurasian continent makes Nur-Sultan an economically advantageous transport, communication and logistics centre, described as a “transit bridge” between Europe and Asia.[^8]

### **Economic Profile**

Nur-Sultan’s metropolitan economy comprises industrial production, transport, communications, trade and construction industries. A leader in construction in Kazakhstan, the capital also leads in the production of building metal products, ready-for-use concrete and concrete building products in the country. After gaining its metropolitan status, 10 million square metres of housing were built in the city.[^9]  

Facilities such as the Tselinograd car-repair plant, Tsesna-Astyk concern, Tulpar-Talgo LLP passenger-car assembly plant and Eurocopter Kazakhstan Engineering LLP helicopter assembly plant are among the city’s largest enterprises. 

With a dynamic entrepreneurial culture, the city is home to more than 128,000 small and medium-sized businesses, making it one of the largest business centres in Kazakhstan.

### **Industry**

Dubai’s economy is based largely on natural resources. However, in the latter half of the 20th century, Dubai’s fast growing knowledge-based and services economy soon matched and almost replaced its revenue from oil. Currently over 90 percent of business activity in Dubai involves trade, logistics, financial services, hospitality and tourism, real estate, construction and manufacturing.[^16]

Under the Dubai Industrial Strategy 2030, there are plans to strengthen the industrial sector to create more jobs for Emiratis. These include 75 key initiatives to generate revenue worth up to US$44 billion, create 27,000 jobs and boost exports by US$4 billion by 2030. The six priority industry sectors that have been identified are aerospace, aluminium and fabricated metals, food and beverage, machinery and equipment, maritime and pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.[^17]

### **Tourism** 

Dubai offers visitors a kaleidoscope of attractions. For instance, the Dubai Museum, located inside the Al Fahidi Fort, offers insights into Arabian culture. In addition, visitors can explore its contrasting landscapes, archaeological sites and a natural sea-water inlet, known as The Creek, which cuts cross the city centre and is the “focal point of life in Dubai”.[^18] Among its top attractions are the Burj Khalifa, Dubai mall and Palm Jumeirah.[^19]

To meet growing demands from the tourism sector, Dubai has developed extensive, world-class hospitality and tourism facilities.[^20] In 2017, 88.2 million passengers passed through the Al Maktoum International Airport, one of the world’s busiest airports.[^21] Plans are laid to start the building of a new airport about 65 kilometres further south.[^22]

### **Singapore and Dubai**

A number of Singapore companies and start-ups have set up businesses in Dubai in sectors such as financial services, logistics, hospitality and urban solutions.[^23] For instance, the Bank of Singapore’s branch in Dubai’s International Financial Centre was officially opened on 19 February 2017.[^24] Others that have followed suit include NSL Limited and KS International.[^25] As for start-ups, in 2018, four percent of the more than 300 applications for Dubai’s fintech accelerator programme were from Singapore. 

The UAE Singapore Business Council conducts talks for members on relevant business issues as well as conduct trade missions to both Dubai and Abu Dhabi.[^26] Enterprise Singapore has also collaborated with FT Consulting to support Singapore companies keen to set up business in Dubai.[^27]

At the government level, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Dubai Financial Services Authority signed an agreement on 29 August 2018 that would allow each party to refer fintech companies to each other, as well as facilitate information sharing on innovation in the financial sector. They also agreed to work on joint projects, such as digital and mobile payments, blockchain and distribution ledgers, Big Data and Application Programming interfaces.[^28]
