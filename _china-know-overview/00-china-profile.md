**Demographic profile**

In 2016, China’s population reached 1.3827 billion. Around 16.7 percent of the population were between the ages 0–14 years; 72.5 percent between 15–64 years; and 10.8 percent were 65 years and above.

In 2016, the population grew by 5.86 percent. It had a birth rate of12.95 per 1,000 population and a death rate of 7.09 per 1,000 population. The sex ratio for the total population was 1.05 males to one female.

In 2016, the urban population made up 57.35 percent of the total population. The population of the major urban areas was as follows: Shanghai (24.2 million), Beijing (21.73 million), Chongqing (30.48 million), and Tianjin (15.62 million).

The largest ethnic group in China is Han Chinese (91.6 percent).



**Economic profile**

The market reforms initiated in 1978 have transformed China from being centrally planned to a market-based economy. It has seen rapid economic growth with GDP (gross domestic product) growth averaging 10 percent per year. Today, it is the second-largest economy in the world and is increasingly playing an influential role in the global economy.

In 2015, China’s strategic emerging industries accounted for about eight percent of its GDP. The 13th five-year plan (2016–2020) aims to increase it to 15 percent by 2020. The five major industries highlighted in the 13th five-year plan are: information technology; high-end manufacturing; biology; green and low carbon; and digital creation.



**Major initiatives**

In 2013, President Xi Jinping unveiled China’s ambitious infrastructure and economic development strategy known Belt and Road Initiative BRI. China is spending around US$150 billion a year to connect more than 60 countries that have signed up to the scheme. They will be connected through a network of railways, roads, pipelines and utility grids linking China with Central Asia, West Asia and parts of South Asia. It comprises more than physical connections and aims to create a platform for economic cooperation, including policy coordination, trade and financing collaboration, and social and cultural cooperation. Its two main components are:

1. The Silk Road Economic Belt – which is envisioned as three routes connecting China to Europe (via Central Asia), the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean (through West Asia), and the Indian Ocean (via South Asia).
2. The 21st Century Maritime Silk Road – which plans to connect regional waterways.

The BRI is currently developing six international economic cooperation corridors, including the New Eurasian Land Bridge, China–Mongolia–Russia, China–Central Asia–West Asia, China Indochina Peninsula, China–Pakistan, and Bangladesh–China–India–Myanmar.




### **Economic growth and integration**

Since its founding, ASEAN has become one of the modern economic success stories. ASEAN’s total is population of 634 million. In 2016, ASEAN’s combined GDP stood at US$2.55 trillion, and was the sixth largest economy in the world.[^3] The region has also seen long periods of peace and prosperity in the absence of inter-regional conflicts and impressive economic growth. Total trade has grown more than six times, from US$400 billion in 1993 to US$2.5 trillion. Poverty has declined and each country has seen its people moving from poor to low-income to middle-income levels.[^4]

The ASEAN economy is expected to grow five percent in 2017 and 2018 as countries in the region continue to enjoy ‘robust economic activity’. For countries that are linked to the global electronics supply chain, their economies are also boosted by demand for electronics.[^5]

### **ASEAN Economic Community (AEC)**

In 2015, the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) was established to promote regional economic integration. The AEC Blueprint 2025 seeks to achieve “the vision of having an AEC by 2025 that is highly integrated and cohesive; competitive, innovative and dynamic; with enhanced connectivity and sectoral cooperation; and a more resilient, inclusive, and people-oriented, people-centred community, integrated with the global economy." It also seeks to ensure that the 10 countries are “sustainably and gainfully integrated in the global economy, thus contributing to the goal of shared prosperity."[^6]

Under the AEC, Singapore manufacturers can export to other ASEAN countries without having to pay tariffs for most products, thus improving manufacturers’ access to these countries. In addition, the freer flow of goods within ASEAN should reduce manufacturing and production costs due to lower costs for raw materials or inputs sourced within the region, thereby increasing the competitiveness of Singapore-manufactured goods.[^7]
