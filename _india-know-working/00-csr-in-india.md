With India’s booming developments, the urban transformation of the country has also brought about gleaming business complexes, giant condominium communities and spacious air-conditioned malls alongside open-air markets. This title documents the new private sector partnerships and practices that are transforming India’s built environment and presents how India’s land is rapidly transforming from a site of agricultural and industrial production to an international finance resource.

[**House, but no garden: Apartment living in Bombay’s Suburbs, 1898 – 1964**](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/Main/Browse?startsWith=P){:target="_blank"}

The author examines the challenge of converting lands from agrarian to urban use through the organisation of the middle-class neighbourhood which had become ubiquitous in the mid-20th century of Bombay’s city fabric. Apartment living is self-contained and represents a novel form of urban life. The author helps us to understand how built environments and urban identities constitute one another.
