### **Singapore and Zhejiang**

The Singapore-Zhejiang Economic and Trade Council was established on 18 November 2003 to promote economic exchanges and cooperation between Zhejiang and Singapore. In the early years, both sides focused mainly on real estate, manufacturing and encouraging the province’s privately owned enterprises to list on the Singapore Exchange. Since then, the focus has expanded to include modern services such as township planning, education, transport, logistics and tourism.[^34] By December 2016, there were 1,157 Singapore projects in Zhejiang. The investments are mainly in real-estate development, auto-parts industry and general equipment manufacturing in cities such as Hangzhou, Ningbo, Zhoushan, Shaoxing and Yiwu.
