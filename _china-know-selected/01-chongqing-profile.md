### **Economy**

Chongqing is one of the fastest growing cities in China, with an annual GDP growth rate of more than 10 percent in recent years.⁸ Besides the construction of the Three Gorges Dam Project, its rapid economic growth could also be attributed to China’s “favourable policies”, particularly the “Go West” strategy launched in 2000, which aims to generate investment in western China. Chongqing has largely benefited from the policy and became a significant trading and manufacturing hub as well as a major gateway to west China.⁹ With its strategic location, Chongqing is also “a key strategic node” of the Belt and Road Initiative, which was unveiled in 2013 and aims to connect 65 countries across three continents through China.¹⁰



### **Industry**

Chongqing is one of China’s oldest industrial bases, and its major industries include automobiles, iron and steel and aluminium. Heavy industry is the backbone of Chongqing, accounting for 74.3 percent of its gross industrial output in 2015.¹¹ However, Chongqing is moving towards the manufacturing of electronic and high technology products. In December 2000, its municipal government established the Chongqing New North Zone (CNNZ), a modern industrial base aimed at developing high-tech industries.¹² This drove many leading multinational enterprises such as Hewlett-Packard, Foxconn, Inventec, Acer, IBM, Honeywell, CISCO and HP, to set up their businesses in Chongqing.¹³

 

### **Foreign trade and investment**

Chongqing’s total imports and exports reached US$74.5 billion in 2015 but declined to US$62.8 billion in 2016.¹⁴ The United States was its leading export market, accounting for 24 percent of its total exports.¹⁵ Other major export markets include Germany, Hong Kong and South Korea. Major import sources were Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia. Singapore’s total imports and exports with Chongqing amounted to US$147.7 million in 2016, a decrease from the US$213.6 million achieved in 2015.¹⁶

Over the years, many multinational companies from the electronic industries have established their presence in Chongqing. By the end of 2016, 272 of the world’s top 500 companies have set up operations there.¹⁷ With the Belt and Road Initiative, Chongqing is expected to seek more foreign investment and trade opportunities.

 

### **Consumer market**

Chongqing is an important consumer market in southwest China due to its large population. Its per capita disposal income of urban households in 2016 was RMB 29,610, an increase of 8.7 percent from 2015.¹⁸ Its total retail sales of consumer goods reached RMB 727.1 billion in 2016, up 13.2 percent from the RMB 642.4 billion achieved the previous year.¹⁹ Some of the major local and overseas retailers that have established their presence in Chongqing include Gome from Beijing, Carrefour from France, Walmart from the United States and Metro from Germany.²⁰

Besides its breathtaking landscapes of mountains, rivers, forests, springs, waterfall gorges and caves, Chongqing also has the Dazu Rock Carvings, the Three Gorges, Small Little Gorges and the Natural Pit and Land Crack in Fengjie.

In August 2017, Singapore and Chongqing signed agreements for two joint ventures: the Chongqing Logistics Development Platform (CLDP) and the Multi-Modal Distribution and Connectivity (DC) Centre. These ventures aim to help “develop Chongqing into an inland international logistics hub and contribute to the development of the CCI Southern Transport Corridor”, which in turn aims to enhance connectivity between west China and Southeast Asia.²³
