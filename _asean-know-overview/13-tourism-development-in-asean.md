[**Rethinking cultural resource management in Southeast Asia: Preservation, development, and neglect** ](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=14500035){:target="_blank"}

This title explores the challenges involved in protecting Southeast Asiaâ€™s indigenous cultures and archaeological sites from the ravages of tourism and economic development. The essays investigate their own set of region-specific Cultural Resource Management strategies, and acknowledge both the necessity and possibility of mediating between the conflicting interests of short-term profitability and long-term sustainability.
