[**Rethinking cultural resource management in Southeast Asia: Preservation, development, and neglect** ](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=14500035){:target="_blank"}

This title explores the challenges involved in protecting Southeast Asia’s indigenous cultures and archaeological sites from the ravages of tourism and economic development. The essays investigate their own set of region-specific Cultural Resource Management strategies, and acknowledge both the necessity and possibility of mediating between the conflicting interests of short-term profitability and long-term sustainability.

Grounded in economic theory and application, the chapters analyse the impacts of tourism on the host community, investigates the productivity of the industry and identify factors which could increase economic and sustainable development in countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.
