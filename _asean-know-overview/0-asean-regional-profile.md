The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a 10-nation regional organisation made up of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. ASEAN was first established on 8 August 1967 in Bangkok, Thailand when the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand signed the ASEAN Declaration.[^1] ASEAN subsequently became a 10-member regional organisation when Brunei Darussalam joined on 7 January 1984, Vietnam on 28 July 1995, Lao PDR and Myanmar on 23 July 1997, and Cambodia on 30 April 1999.[^2]

Since its founding, ASEAN has become one of the modern economic success stories. ASEAN’s total is population of 634 million. In 2016, ASEAN’s combined GDP stood at US$2.55 trillion, and was the sixth largest economy in the world.[^3] The region has also seen long periods of peace and prosperity in the absence of inter-regional conflicts and impressive economic growth. Total trade has grown more than six times, from US$400 billion in 1993 to US$2.5 trillion. Poverty has declined and each country has seen its people moving from poor to low-income to middle-income levels.[^4]
