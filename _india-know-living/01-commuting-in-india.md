With India’s booming developments, the urban transformation of the country has also brought about gleaming business complexes, giant condominium communities and spacious air-conditioned malls alongside open-air markets. This title documents the new private sector partnerships and practices that are transforming India’s built environment and presents how India’s land is rapidly transforming from a site of agricultural and industrial production to an international finance resource.

The author examines the challenge of converting lands from agrarian to urban use through the organisation of the middle-class neighbourhood which had become ubiquitous in the mid-20th century of Bombay’s city fabric. Apartment living is self-contained and represents a novel form of urban life. The author helps us to understand how built environments and urban identities constitute one another.

[**The vanishing stepwells of India**](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=202864681)

Stepwells – ancient water stores – which are found below ground are unique to India. Built from around the third century throughout the country particularly in the arid western regions, these stepwells also serve a place where villagers could socialise and for travellers to take refuge from the heat. Journalist Victoria Lautman first encountered stepwells three decades ago and is now devoted to document these fascinating but largely unknown edifices before they disappear.
